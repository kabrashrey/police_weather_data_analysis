# Police Activity and Weather Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic stop data from Rhode Island police departments combined with weather data to understand patterns in police activity, identify potential biases, and examine how environmental conditions affect law enforcement outcomes.

## Data Sources
- **Police Data**: 86,536 traffic stop records from Rhode Island (2005-2015)
- **Weather Data**: Daily weather conditions including temperature, precipitation, and adverse weather events

## Key Findings
### **Demographic Patterns**
- **Gender Disparity**: Male drivers are searched 2.4x more often than female drivers (4.54% vs 1.92%)
- **Search Patterns**: Males are frisked more frequently during searches (9.44% vs 7.46%)
- **Violation Types**: Females are more likely stopped for speeding, while males face more moving violations

### **Temporal Trends**
- **Peak Arrest Hours**: Highest arrest rates occur between 1-3 AM
- **Decade-long Increase**: Both drug-related stops and search rates rose significantly from 2005-2015
- **Most Common Violation**: Speeding accounts for 56% of all traffic stops

### **Weather Impact**
- **Arrest Rate Correlation**: Poor weather conditions increase arrest rates
- **Equipment Violations**: Most affected by weather (9.74% arrest rate in bad weather vs 5.90% in good weather)
- **Speeding**: Minimal weather impact on arrest rates

### **Geographic Distribution**
- **High-Activity Zone**: Zone K3 records the highest number of stops across all violation types
- **District Variations**: Different districts show varying patterns of violations and enforcement

## Technical Approach
The analysis employs comprehensive data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). The project demonstrates effective handling of missing data, temporal analysis, and multi-dimensional data exploration.

## Implications
This analysis reveals important insights about potential biases in police enforcement, the influence of environmental factors on law enforcement decisions, and temporal patterns that could inform policy and training initiatives.
