Police Activity and Weather Data Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic stop data from Rhode Island police departments in conjunction with weather data. The goal is to uncover patterns in police activity, identify potential demographic or geographic disparities, and examine how environmental conditions influence law enforcement outcomes.

Data Sources
	•	Police Data: 86,536 traffic stop records from Rhode Island (2005–2015)
	•	Weather Data: Daily weather information including temperature, precipitation, and adverse weather events

Key Findings

Demographic Patterns
	•	Gender Disparity: Male drivers are searched 2.4x more often than female drivers (4.54% vs. 1.92%).
	•	Search Patterns: Male drivers are frisked more frequently during searches (9.44% vs. 7.46%).
	•	Violation Types: Female drivers are more likely to be stopped for speeding, while male drivers face more moving violations.

Temporal Trends
	•	Peak Arrest Hours: Highest arrest rates occur between 1–3 AM.
	•	Decade-long Increase: Drug-related stops and searches increased significantly from 2005–2015.
	•	Most Common Violation: Speeding accounts for 56% of all traffic stops.

Weather Impact
	•	Arrest Rate Correlation: Poor weather conditions increase overall arrest rates.
	•	Equipment Violations: Most affected by weather (9.74% arrest rate in bad weather vs. 5.90% in good weather).
	•	Speeding: Minimal weather impact on arrest likelihood.

Geographic Distribution
	•	High-Activity Zone: Zone K3 records the highest number of stops across all violation types.
	•	District Variations: Enforcement patterns differ significantly across districts.

Technical Approach
	•	Data cleaning, preprocessing, and handling of missing values
	•	Statistical and temporal trend analysis
	•	Multi-dimensional exploration of demographic, temporal, and geographic factors
	•	Visualizations created with Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)

Implications

This analysis highlights key insights into law enforcement practices, including:
	•	Potential gender-based disparities in searches and arrests
	•	The influence of weather conditions on enforcement decisions
	•	Temporal and geographic patterns that may guide policy reforms and training programs
